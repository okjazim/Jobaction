# Jobaction (Work in Progress)
JobAction is a job board platform where job seekers can search, apply, and save jobs, while employers can post listings and manage applications. It uses React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. JWT handles authentication, and Tailwind CSS provides a responsive design, with Axios used for API requests.
