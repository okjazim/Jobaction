# Jobaction (Work in Progress)
**JobAction** is a job board platform where job seekers can search, apply, and save jobs, while employers can post listings and manage applications.

The frontend is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a simple, responsive design. The backend is developed in **Python (Flask)** to handle routing, job operations, and **API** endpoints. Supabase is used for data storage and user management, with its built-in **JWT-based authentication** ensuring secure logins and protected routes. All client–server communication happens through **RESTful API** requests using the native fetch **API**.
